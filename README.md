# Introduction to Serverless: Virtual Assistant

This is an introductudory tutorial for how to get started with Serverless technologies. In this tutorial
we will be learning how to develop serverless application with the Serverless Framework and AWS by creating a
virtual assistant chatbot for the Telegram instant messenger.

This tutorial is targeted for people with little to no previous experience with serverless. Previous knowledge of
programming is assumed but not strictly necessary as this tutorial can be complited by copy pasting examples.

This tutorial is intended as a part of a hands-on workshop where it is accompanied by lectures and assistants.
However, the tutorial can be completed independently in isolation and can give valuable introduction to the tools
used without help of auxiliary material.

## How to get started?

The tutorial is split in two part. The part one instructions are in [part-1-instructions.md](./part-1-instructions.md)
and part two in [part-2-instructions.md](./part-2-instructions.md).

This repository contains example code and is organised in three branches:
* Branch `master` contains example of a completed tutorial. It is identical to `step-2`
* Branch `step-1` contains an example solution for Part One. At the end of the Part One your project directory should look similar to this branch.
* Branch `step-2` contains an example solution for Part Two. At the end of the Part Two your project directory should look similar to this branch.
